lot
===

Sometimes I want to get a list of open browser tabs, particularly from
a remote machine. This script does so; it does not require the browser
to be running, as it looks in the session backup.

At the moment, it works for Firefox only.

Installation
------------

Run `pipx install git+https://github.com/bensteinberg/lot.git`.

Usage
-----

Run `lot`.
