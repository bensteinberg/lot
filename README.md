Sometimes I want to get a list of open browser tabs, particularly from
a remote machine. This script does so; it does not require the browser
to be running, as it looks in the session backup.

At the moment, it works for Firefox only, and only looks at the first
profile it finds.

To install, run `pip install git+https://github.com/bensteinberg/lot.git`.
